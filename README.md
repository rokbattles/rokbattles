## What is ROK Battles

ROK Battles is a community-driven platform for sharing battle reports and surfacing actionable trends in Rise of Kingdoms. With explicit opt-in, in-game mails (primarily battle reports) are relayed to our backend, parsed, and aggregated into public datasets. These datasets power real-time browsing of battle reports alongside battle details—including commanders, equipment, armaments, and inscriptions—and drive trend exploration; no account required to explore.

## Project Status

This project is currently in early development. We're excited to share our work with the community and welcome your feedback! While we're actively improving things, please note that:

* Some APIs may change as we refine our approach
* Documentation might be incomplete in places
* There may be rough edges we haven't smoothed out yet

We welcome contributions through GitHub issues and pull requests.
