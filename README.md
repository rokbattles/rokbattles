## What is ROK Toolkit

ROK Toolkit is a community-driven analytics and tooling platform for Rise of Kingdoms. By opting in, governors can automatically relay in-game mails (primarily battle reports) to our backend, where it's parsed and aggregated. The resulting insights are published on the site for everyone to explore. No account required to browse.

## Feature highlights

* Discover meta trends: See which commanders, equipment, armaments, and inscriptions are being used across the community.
* Explore loadouts: Browse common equipment and armament combinations, and filter by troop type, commander pairings, and more.
* Benchmark performance: Understand which loadouts show up most in successful reports and how usage shifts over time.
