## What is ROK Toolkit

ROK Toolkit is a community-driven platform for sharing battle reports and surfacing actionable trends in Rise of Kingdoms. With explicit opt-in, in-game mails (primarily battle reports) are relayed to our backend, parsed, and aggregated into public datasets. These datasets power real-time browsing of battle reports alongside battle details—including commanders, equipment, armaments, and inscriptions—and drive trend exploration; no account required to explore.

## Project goals

- Short-term
  - Publish and maintain public datasets (commanders, equipment, armaments, inscriptions).
  - Deliver transparent trend views (usage rates, popularity over time) and simple loadout exploration with basic filters.
  - Stabilize the ingestion and parsing pipeline with validation and public schemas.

- Long-term
  - Provide rich meta analytics: common pairings, performance benchmarks, counters, and shifts across patches/time.
  - Ship developer APIs/SDKs for third-party tools and research.
  - Add advanced filtering and personalized insights while keeping browsing account-free.

## Current status

- Datasets: initial datasets are available and mostly complete; translations are in progress.
- Code: the first crates are available and primarily internal at this stage.
