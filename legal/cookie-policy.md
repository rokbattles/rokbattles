This Cookie Policy explains how Sylke Technologies, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (“Sylke Technologies,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with the ROK Battles website [www.rokbattles.com](https://www.rokbattles.com) (the “Website”) and related services.

This policy should be read together with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. By continuing to use the Website after seeing a cookie banner or notice, you consent to the use of cookies as described here, unless you disable them using the methods outlined below.

**2\. What Are Cookies?**  
Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They are widely used to enable websites to function efficiently, to remember user preferences, and to provide insights into how websites are used.

Types of cookies include:

- **First-party cookies:** Set directly by the website you are visiting.
- **Third-party cookies:** Set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, often used for integrations or security.
- **Session cookies:** Expire when you close your browser.
- **Persistent cookies:** Remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them.

**3\. Types of Cookies We Use**

1. **Strictly Necessary Cookies**
    - Purpose: Essential for the operation of the Website, including page navigation, load balancing, security, and access to secure areas.
    - Legal Basis: Contractual necessity.
    - Example: Session authentication tokens; Cloudflare security cookies.
2. **Functional Cookies**
    - Purpose: Enable enhanced functionality and personalization, such as remembering preferences.

    - Example: Preference cookies for language or theme settings.
3. **Analytics Cookies**
    - Purpose: Collect information about how visitors use the Website to help us improve performance and usability.
    - Legal Basis: Legitimate interests (where allowed) or consent.

    - Purpose: Set when the Website integrates with services such as Discord (authentication), Stripe (payments), Cloudflare (security and content delivery), and OVHcloud (hosting infrastructure).
    - Legal Basis: Consent where required by law.

We do not use cookies for targeted advertising, behavioral profiling, or “selling” data under the CCPA/CPRA.

**4\. Legal Basis for Cookies (GDPR/UK GDPR)**

- Strictly necessary cookies may be placed without consent, as they are essential for the Website to function.
- All other cookies require your consent, which we obtain through a cookie banner or consent management tool.
- You may withdraw your consent at any time through the cookie settings provided on the Website.

**5\. Your Choices & Control**  
You can control cookies in several ways:

- **Cookie Banner/Settings:** Accept or reject categories of cookies via our consent tool.
- **Browser Settings:** Most browsers allow blocking or deleting cookies.
- **Third-Party Tools:** Some opt-out mechanisms exist (e.g., NAI, DAA), though ROK Battles does not use advertising cookies.

Disabling cookies may impair certain features, including authentication and personalization.
