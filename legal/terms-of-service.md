# Terms of Service

Effective date: 15 September 2025

**Welcome to ROK Battles**

Welcome, and thank you for being part of the ROK Battles community. ROK Battles is a passion project created for players of _Rise of Kingdoms_, designed to give the community tools to share, explore, and analyze battle reports in a more meaningful way.

These Terms of Service are more than fine print: they are the framework that allows this community to exist safely and fairly. They establish the ground rules for how the Services work, what you can expect from us, and what we expect from you in return. Because ROK Battles is still evolving, these Terms also anticipate future features such as accounts, premium services, and integrations with third-party platforms (including but not limited to Discord and Stripe).

By using ROK Battles, you are entering into a legally binding contract with Sylke Technologies, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company. Please read these Terms carefully. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Services.

**1\. Introduction & Agreement to Terms**

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding contract between you (“you,” “User”) and Sylke Technologies, LLC, a United States limited liability company (“Sylke Technologies,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), governing your use of the ROK Battles website, the ROK Battles desktop application, related APIs, and all content, features, and services we make available through them (collectively, the “Services”).

By accessing, installing, or otherwise using the Services, you represent that you have read and understood these Terms, and you agree to be bound by them. If you do not agree, you must not use the Services.

These Terms apply solely to ROK Battles. They do not extend to other websites, software projects, or services operated by Sylke Technologies, even if they share common infrastructure or branding.

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms on our website and may provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Services after any such update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

**2\. Eligibility & Geographic Scope**

To use the Services, you must meet certain requirements:

1. **Minimum Age.** You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country) to use the Services. If you are under 18 but above the minimum age, you may only use the Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms on your behalf.
2. **Legal Capacity.** You must have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract with Sylke Technologies.
3. **No Restricted Use.** You may not use the Services if you are located in a jurisdiction subject to comprehensive U.S. sanctions, or if your use would otherwise violate applicable export control or trade laws.

The Services are made available to a global audience. However, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services complies with the laws of the country or region in which you reside.

**3\. Description of Services**

ROK Battles is a community-driven platform built by players, for players. Its purpose is to make the strategic elements of _Rise of Kingdoms_ more transparent and engaging by enabling the sharing and analysis of battle reports.

- **The Website.** The primary experience is hosted at \[[www.rokbattles.com](http://www.rokbattles.com)\]. The website allows users to explore uploaded reports, view aggregated statistics, and analyze trends.
- **The Application.** We provide a downloadable desktop app that allows users to upload reports to the platform. The app is for submission only; exploration and analysis take place on the website.

The Services are offered on a free-to-use basis at this time. In the future, we may introduce additional features, including account-based services, authentication through Discord, and premium offerings available through Stripe-powered payment processing.

The Services are provided “as is.” We are continuously developing and improving them, and you acknowledge that features may change, break, or be discontinued without notice. We make no commitment to maintain backward compatibility or to preserve particular reports, trends, or features indefinitely.

**4\. Open-Source & GitHub Repository**

The Services are powered in part by software that is publicly available as an open-source project at \[[https://github.com/rokbattles/rokbattles](https://github.com/rokbattles/rokbattles?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\]. That source code is distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and the MIT License (collectively, the “Open-Source Licenses”).

Your rights with respect to the source code are determined solely by those Open-Source Licenses. Nothing in these Terms is intended to alter, expand, or restrict your rights under the Open-Source Licenses. However, your use of the hosted Services (the website, the app, and the APIs we operate) is governed exclusively by these Terms.

Where these Terms conflict with the Open-Source Licenses, the Open-Source Licenses control your use of the source code, while these Terms control your use of the Services.

**5\. No Affiliation with Lilith Games**

ROK Battles is an independent, community-created project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Lilith Games or any of its subsidiaries.

_Rise of Kingdoms®_ and all associated names, characters, artwork, assets, and trademarks are the exclusive property of Lilith Games and/or its licensors. All such intellectual property is used here strictly for reference, community commentary, and educational purposes.

You understand and agree that nothing in these Terms grants you any rights in or to the intellectual property of Lilith Games. Your use of the Services does not constitute permission to use _Rise of Kingdoms_ assets outside the scope of what is permitted under fair use and applicable law.

**6\. Accounts & Authentication**

At present, many features of the Services are available without a user account. In the future, certain features may require registration and authentication.

- **Third-Party Authentication.** We plan to provide login and registration through third-party providers, beginning with Discord. If you create an account using a third-party authentication service, you authorize us to collect and store limited information from that service in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
- **Your Responsibility.** You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for any activity conducted under your account. If you believe your account has been compromised, you must notify us promptly.
- **Our Rights.** We may suspend or terminate accounts at our discretion, including where an account violates these Terms, poses a security or legal risk, or is otherwise deemed harmful to the community.

Accounts are a privilege, not a right, and Sylke Technologies reserves sole discretion in their management.

**7\. User Content (Battle Reports, Data Uploads)**

The heart of ROK Battles is the content you and other users contribute. This includes battle reports, metadata, and related materials you upload through the Services (“User Content”).

1. **Ownership.** You retain all ownership rights in your User Content.
2. **License to Us.** By submitting User Content, you grant Sylke Technologies a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, reproduce, display, analyze, distribute, and create derivative works from your User Content for the purpose of operating, improving, and promoting the Services.
3. **Your Representations.** You represent and warrant that:
    - You own or have sufficient rights to submit the User Content.
    - Your User Content does not infringe or violate the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any third party.
    - Your User Content does not contain material that is defamatory, obscene, harassing, hateful, or otherwise unlawful.
4. **Our Rights.** We do not pre-screen User Content, but we reserve the right to remove, disable, or restrict access to any User Content at any time and for any reason, without liability.

By contributing to ROK Battles, you help build a community resource. You also accept that your contributions may be aggregated, transformed, or analyzed as part of the platform’s functionality.

**8\. Platform Content & Intellectual Property**

Except as expressly provided under the Open-Source Licenses referenced above, all intellectual property rights in and to the Services—including but not limited to the ROK Battles name, logo, website design, database architecture, visual interfaces, and non-open-sourced components of the platform—are owned by Sylke Technologies and its licensors.

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use the Services solely for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms. Nothing in these Terms transfers to you any ownership interest in the Services, or grants you any rights to use Sylke Technologies’ trademarks, logos, or trade dress without our prior written consent.

All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. Any unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in termination of your access to the Services and potential legal action.

**9\. Acceptable Use Policy**

To protect the integrity and safety of the Services, you agree not to misuse them. Misuse includes, but is not limited to:

- Accessing, probing, or attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the Services, APIs, or related systems.
- Using automated scripts, bots, or scrapers to collect, harvest, or otherwise extract data without our prior written consent.
- Uploading malicious code, including viruses, worms, or other software intended to disrupt, damage, or interfere with the operation of the Services or users’ devices.
- Using the Services in a manner that violates applicable law, infringes on third-party rights, or facilitates fraudulent or abusive conduct.
- Circumventing or attempting to circumvent security features, authentication mechanisms, or usage limitations we impose.

We reserve the right to investigate violations of this Acceptable Use Policy, and to suspend or terminate accounts or access to the Services where we reasonably believe such violations have occurred.

**10\. Premium Services & Payments**

While the Services are currently free to use, we anticipate introducing premium features in the future. If you choose to purchase or subscribe to such features, the following terms will apply:

1. **Payment Processing.** All payments will be processed by third-party providers, including Stripe, and are subject to their terms and conditions. We do not store or process your payment card information directly.
2. **Billing & Subscriptions.** Premium features may be offered on a subscription basis. If so, subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled prior to the end of the billing cycle.
3. **Refunds.** Except where required by law, all payments are non-refundable. Specific refund or cancellation policies, if any, will be disclosed at the time of purchase.
4. **Taxes.** You are responsible for all applicable taxes arising from your use of premium features, except taxes based on our net income.

By purchasing premium features, you authorize us and our payment processors to charge your chosen payment method for all applicable fees.

**11\. Third-Party Services & Integrations**

The Services integrate with certain third-party platforms and providers, including but not limited to:

- **Discord.** For account creation and authentication.
- **Stripe.** For payment processing of premium features.

Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies, which are incorporated herein by reference. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the availability, security, or performance of third-party services.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Sylke Technologies disclaims liability for any harm, loss, or dispute arising from your use of third-party services, whether accessed directly through the Services or indirectly.

**12\. User Responsibilities**

You agree to use the Services in a responsible manner. Specifically, you represent and warrant that you will:

- Provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information when creating an account or submitting content.
- Respect the rights of other users and third parties, including intellectual property rights.
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including those governing online conduct, data protection, and export controls.
- Maintain the security of your devices and networks when accessing the Services.

You are solely responsible for any consequences, including in-game consequences within _Rise of Kingdoms_, that result from your use of the Services. Sylke Technologies is not responsible for your strategic decisions, in-game outcomes, or losses resulting from reliance on analytics provided through the Services.

**13\. Contribution of Code or Features**

ROK Battles is maintained as an open-source project. We welcome contributions, subject to the following conditions:

1. **License of Contributions.** By submitting code, documentation, or other materials to the ROK Battles repository, you agree that your contributions are licensed under both the MIT License and the Apache License, Version 2.0.
2. **Contributor Warranty.** You represent that your contributions are original to you, do not infringe the rights of any third party, and are free of malicious or harmful code.
3. **Review & Acceptance.** All contributions are subject to review by Sylke Technologies and may be accepted, rejected, or modified at our sole discretion.

Nothing in these Terms obligates Sylke Technologies to include any contribution in the Services.

**14\. Data Collection & Privacy**

Our approach to data collection is intentionally minimal. The App transmits limited metadata when making requests to our APIs, including the App version, operating system, CPU architecture, and the version of the Tauri framework used. This data is embedded in the User-Agent header for the purposes of debugging, compatibility, and service improvement.

In the future, if you create an account, we will collect additional information through our authentication provider (currently Discord) and our payment processor (Stripe). We will never store your payment card details.

Your use of the Services is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains in greater detail what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your personal information.

**15\. Data Security**

We take commercially reasonable measures to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of information transmitted to and through the Services. These measures may include encryption, access controls, and monitoring of system activity.

That said, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. You understand and agree that Sylke Technologies cannot guarantee absolute security of your information. You are responsible for implementing appropriate safeguards on your own devices and networks, including maintaining updated software and using security tools appropriate to your circumstances.

If you suspect a security vulnerability or breach related to the Services, we encourage you to report it promptly using the contact information provided in Section 25.

**16\. Children’s Use**

The Services are not directed to, and may not be used by, children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not access or use the Services under any circumstances.

If you are between 13 and 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher), you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. Parents and guardians who permit their children to use the Services accept full responsibility for the child’s use, including any financial transactions, communications, or content submitted.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.

**17\. Changes to Services**

The Services are dynamic and subject to ongoing development. Accordingly, Sylke Technologies reserves the right to:

- Add, remove, or modify features, content, or functionality;
- Impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts of the Services;
- Discontinue, suspend, or terminate the Services in whole or in part;

at any time, with or without notice, and without liability to you.

We may also release updates, patches, or new versions of the App or related software that may be required for continued use of the Services. You acknowledge that failure to install such updates may limit or prevent your ability to use the Services.

**18\. Termination & Suspension**

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, or to specific features, at any time and for any reason, including but not limited to:

- Violation of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy;
- Conduct that we reasonably believe may cause harm to the Services, to other users, or to Sylke Technologies;
- Compliance with legal requirements or governmental requests.

You may terminate your account at any time by discontinuing use of the Services and, if applicable, deleting your account through the provided mechanisms.

Upon termination:

- Your right to access the Services immediately ceases;
- Certain licenses granted by you to us (e.g., with respect to User Content) shall continue;
- Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 7, 8, 19, 20, and 21) shall remain in effect.

**19\. Disclaimers of Warranties**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Services are provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

Without limiting the foregoing, Sylke Technologies specifically disclaims:

- Any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement;
- Any warranties that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free;
- Any warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or availability of content, analytics, or reports generated by the Services.

You acknowledge that the Services are experimental in nature, subject to ongoing development, and may contain bugs, errors, or defects. You further acknowledge that any reliance on the Services, including for strategic or in-game decisions, is at your sole risk.

**20\. Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sylke Technologies and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents shall not be liable for:

- Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost data, loss of goodwill, or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services;
- Any damages arising from unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;
- Any damages resulting from your interactions with third-party services, including Discord and Stripe.

In no event shall our aggregate liability to you exceed the greater of: (a) the total fees you paid to us for premium features in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to liability, or (b) one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability for certain types of damages. In such jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

**21\. Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sylke Technologies and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in any way connected with:

- Your access to or use of the Services;
- Your User Content, including claims that it infringes or violates the rights of any third party;
- Your violation of these Terms or applicable law;
- Your misuse of third-party services integrated into the platform.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In such case, you agree to cooperate with us in the defense of such matter.

**22\. Export Controls & Sanctions Compliance**

The Services are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

By accessing or using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not:

- Located in a country or territory subject to comprehensive U.S. government sanctions (including, without limitation, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or the Crimea, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions of Ukraine);
- Designated on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties;
- Using the Services for any purpose prohibited under U.S. law, including the development or production of weapons of mass destruction.

You agree to comply fully with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Services.

**23\. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution**

These Terms, and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them or their subject matter, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Wisconsin, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

**Venue.** You agree that any legal action or proceeding between you and Sylke Technologies related to these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Wisconsin, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

**Waiver of Jury Trial.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and Sylke Technologies each waive the right to a trial by jury in any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms.

**International Users.** If you are located outside the United States, you agree that U.S. laws and jurisdiction will apply to the fullest extent permissible under local law, and that you are responsible for ensuring your compliance with local laws in addition to these Terms.

**24\. Severability & Waiver**

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, consistent with the original intent of the parties.

No waiver by Sylke Technologies of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition. Any failure by Sylke Technologies to assert a right or enforce a provision shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**25\. Notices & Contact Information**

All notices required or permitted under these Terms shall be in writing and shall be deemed given:

- When delivered personally;
- When sent by confirmed email;
- Three (3) business days after being sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or
- One (1) business day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier service.

Notices to Sylke Technologies shall be sent to:

Email: [privacy@sylketech.com](mailto:privacy@sylketech.com)

If we need to contact you, we will use the information you provided at registration (if applicable), or we may post a general notice on the Services.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Sylke Technologies with respect to your use of ROK Battles. They supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the Services.

By continuing to access or use ROK Battles, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
